# Episode 4 — Preparing Quantum States: Superposition (One Qubit)

**This episode covers** how to take the initialized state \( |0\rangle \) to an equal superposition \( (|0\rangle + |1\rangle)/\sqrt{2} \) using either the **Hadamard** gate or a **\(R_y(\pi/2)\)** rotation, and how to visualize and verify the result.

## 🎯 Learning goals

- Understand the target **equal superposition** state.
- Prepare it with **Hadamard** and with **rotations**.
- Visualize states on the **Bloch sphere**.
- Verify numerical equivalence of both methods.
- (Optional) Simulate measurements and inspect **counts**.
