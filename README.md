## ðŸ“– About this Course

**Mastering Qiskit v2.0** is a complete learning series designed to take you from the very basics of quantum circuits to running optimized workloads on IBM Quantum hardware.  
The course is based on the latest **Qiskit v2.0** SDK and IBM Quantum Platform updates.

This repository contains:

- All course materials (notebooks, code, and visual assets)
- The official episode roadmap
- Example circuits and visualizations
- Ready-to-run Qiskit v2.0 code

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

By the end of this series, you will be able to:

- Set up your environment and connect to IBM Quantum hardware
- Prepare and manipulate quantum states
- Use the Qiskit SDK effectively for building and optimizing circuits
- Apply measurement strategies and visualize results
- Implement advanced circuit techniques
- Work with operators, observables, and execution primitives
- Run jobs on real hardware and apply error mitigation
